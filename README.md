Perform the predictive analytics (classification) on predicting the whether the patient is frequent buyer of medicine or not.Use different classification techniques and compare the results. Perform the data pre-processing (normalization, standardization, correlation analysis & feature section, dimension reduction using PCA) and compare the results of classification with unprocessed data.
